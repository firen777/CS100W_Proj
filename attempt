assume all characters are distinct

base case: when string has length of 1 or 0, return itself

recursive rule: move every character to the first and then do the recursive call on the rest part
                Ex. |ABCDE|- keep A, do recursive call on BCDE......
                    |BACDE|- keep B, do recursive call on ACDE......
                    |     |
                      /|\
                       |
                       |
           this part can have a for loop               recursive call in for loop
